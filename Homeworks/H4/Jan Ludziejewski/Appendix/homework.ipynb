Previous analysis concluted, that this client was correctly predicted to purchase, because of his wealth, and despite his mortage payment, beeing its second most important variable. However, most important variable N_OPEN_REV_ACTS=27 as we see on the plot, has completly flat neighborhood, so its only important that its bigger then 10. Also, slight non-monotonicity in its plot before 10 seems to be an effect of an overfit. Other plots do not suggest great influence on the model, considering TREATMENT as well.
