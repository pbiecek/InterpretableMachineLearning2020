Add your third homework as a pull request to this folder.

Deadline 2020-04-02 EOD


Task:
For a selected dataset (you can use data from your project or data from Homework 1) prepare a knitr/jupiter notebook with the following points.
Submit your results on GitHub to the directory Homeworks/H3.

TODO:

1. For the selected data set, train a predictive model
2. for some selected observation from this dataset, calculate the model predictions for model (1)
3. for an observation selected in (2), calculate the decomposition of model prediction using LIME / live / lime / localModel or similar technique (packages for R: live, live, localModel, iml, packages for python: lime).
4. compare LIME decompositions for different observations in the dataset. How stable are these explanations?
5. train a second model (of any class, neural nets, linear, other boosting) and find an observation for which LIME attributions are different between the models
6. Comment on the results for points (4) and (5)
