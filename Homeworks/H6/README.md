Add your sixth homework as a pull request to this folder.

Deadline 2020-05-14 EOD


Task:
For a selected data set (you can use data from your project or data from Homework 1) prepare a knitr/jupiter notebook with the following points.
Submit your results on GitHub to the directory Homeworks/H6.

TODO:

1. For the selected data set, train at least one tree-based ensemble model (random forest, gbm, catboost or any other boosting)
2. for selected variables from the model (1) calculate Partial Dependence Profiles and Accumulated Local Dependence 
3. train a second model with a different structure (neural nets, linear, other boosting) and find a variable that has different behaviour between models
4. Comment on the results for points (2) and (3)



**Important note:**

The submitted homework should be in html format (generated from a knitter/jupiter) and should consist of two parts. 

The first part is the key results and comments from points 2-4. In this part **PLESE DO NOT SHOW ANY R/PYTHON CODES, RESULTS (IMAGES, COMMENTS) ONLY.**

The second part should start with the word Appendix or Załącznik and should include the reproducible R/PYTHON code used to implement points 1-4.

Such division 1. will make these homework more readable, 2. will create good habits related to reporting.
