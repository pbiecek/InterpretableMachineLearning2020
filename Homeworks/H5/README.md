Add your fifth homework as a pull request to this folder.

Deadline 2020-05-04 EOD


Task:
For a selected data set (you can use data from your project or data from Homework 1) prepare a knitr/jupiter notebook with the following points.
Submit your results on GitHub to the directory Homeworks/H5.

TODO:

1. For the selected data set, train at least one tree-based ensemble model (random forest, gbm, catboost or any other boosting)
2. calculate permutational variable importance for the selected model,
3. train three or more candidate models (different variables, different transformations, different model structures) and compare ranking of important features between these models. Are they similar or different?
4. Comment on the results for points (2) and (3)



**Important note:**

The submitted homework should be in html format (generated from a knitter/jupiter) and should consist of two parts. 

The first part is the key results and comments from points 3-4. In this part **PLESE DO NOT SHOW ANY R/PYTHON CODES, RESULTS (IMAGES, COMMENTS) ONLY.**

The second part should start with the word Appendix or Załącznik and should include the reproducible R/PYTHON code used to implement points 1-4.

Such division 1. will make these homework more readable, 2. will create good habits related to reporting.
